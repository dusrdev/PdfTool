## FAQ

Q: Will I add options?

A: Probably not this was made as a very simple solution to a specific problem

Q: I am not running windows, are there versions for other platforms?

A: This application is written and .NET 6 and all the dependencies are .NET CORE 2+ so in theory it is cross platform and should work about the same in MacOS and Linux, but, you'll have to download the project and build the executable to your specific configuration

Q: I want to be able to use it on computers without the need to download .Net runtime dependencies, is it possible?

A: Yes, download the "self-contained" from [Releases](https://github.com/dusrdev/PdfTool/releases), extract it a new folder, and create a shortcut for the executable or launch directly from said folder.

## Installation
